{Preliminaries}


\paragraph{Change Log}
\begin{itemize}
\item v1.0 12/04/2014 - In this release we made more corrections to the requirements document in order to keep it up to date. We implemented newtaems tokens which allows us to add nodes and relationships in the middle of a simulation. We also updated our messages giving Agents the ability to communicate with each other. Finally we updated the Javadoc's for our project and completed some final integration testing for the newtaems features.
\item v0.5 11/14/2014 - In this release we continued to work on the requirements document correcting spelling, fixing mistakes and updating the verification plan. We also worked on writing new tests to increase the branch and overall instruction coverage to help improve the over all accuracy. We have worked on incorporating all the requirements mentioned in SRS document in the tasktree and the simulationstate module. We have also started updating the Javadoc for the project.
\item v0.4 10/31/2014 - In this release we continued to work on the requirements
document making images clearer, correcting spelling, and fixing formatting mistakes. We incorporated comprehensive coverage testing and created a verification plan to help improve our software accuracy. We were able to link the main modules of our program to provide the first runnable iteration where we created a simple external agent to assist in the running of a basic simulation. 
\item v0.3 10/17/2014 - Fixed several errors in the document in terms
of spelling and grammar. Updated the USES diagrams of the system and the tasktree package. Added detailed descriptions of the cTAEMS grammar and the task tree. Gave more detail on each stakeholder. Updated the ERD to reflect their proper language. Added descriptions of the interface that the Agents must adhere too. Added sample messages of each type for the Agents. Added an example task tree to show how a small scale simulation would run. Removed the cost attribute from the task tree. Updated the description of each module and package. Added a test verification plan. Converted most applicable images to the SVG format. Removed references to the Event Engine as it is no longer needed. Changed Event to Node as it fits the task tree design better. Added more detail to some of the Core Features. Added more terms to the Definition of Concepts.
\item v0.2 10/03/1014 - This release focused on clarifying the project
requirements and incorporating some basic design ideas. We worked to correct errors in the document pointed out by our client and instructor and added some additional content and figures. The most notable change is the addition of Chapter 5, Detailed System Design, where we began describing the transition from requirements to actual code.
\item v0.1 09/19/2014 - Initial Document Release
\end{itemize}
