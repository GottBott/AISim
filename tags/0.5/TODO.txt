- Output
	- Need to output a log of all events
	- Need to print some events to the screen during simulation

- Tasktree
	- Relationships need to be looked at again (they don't quite seem to follow the ctaems spec)

- Simulation
	- Messages
		- Need a start simulation message
		- Need an end simulation message
		- Maybe need a new type of message to send initial tree data to each agent
		- Maybe need a new type of message to indicate that a new tick has started
	- Simulator
		- Need to activate relationships
		- Need to send initial tree to agents
		- Need to send other new types of messages
		- Need to use logger

- Tests
	- Need to figure out why the ServerListenThread tests randomly fail
	- Input Parser needs better tests
