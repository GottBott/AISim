{Preliminaries}


\paragraph{Change Log}
\begin{itemize}
\item v0.3 10/17/2014 - Fixed several errors in the document in terms
of spelling and grammar. Updated the USES diagrams of the system and the tasktree package. Added detailed descriptions of the cTAEMS grammar and the task tree. Gave more detail on each stakeholder. Updated the ERD to reflect their proper language. Added descriptions of the interface that the Agents must adhere too. Added sample messages of each type for the Agents. Added an example task tree to show how a small scale simulation would run. Removed the cost attribute from the task tree. Updated the description of each module and package. Added a test verification plan. Converted most applicable images to the SVG format. Removed references to the Event Engine as it is no longer needed. Changed Event to Node as it fits the task tree design better. Added more detail to some of the Core Features. Added more terms to the Definition of Concepts.
\item v0.2 10/03/1014 - This release focused on clarifying the project
requirements and incorporating some basic design ideas. We worked to correct errors in the document pointed out by our client and instructor and added some additional content and figures. The most notable change is the addition of Chapter 5, Detailed System Design, where we began describing the transition from requirements to actual code.
\item v0.1 09/19/2014 - Initial Document Release
\end{itemize}
